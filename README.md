# SE 350: Object-Oriented Software Development

### Course Description ###
Principles, techniques and tools of object-oriented modeling, design, implementation, and testing of large-scale software systems. Topics include design patterns, application frameworks, architectural design, and the applications in the software development process to improve the extensibility, maintainability, and reliability of software systems. 

### Tools Used ###
* Any Java IDE

### Notes ###
Inside each folder you will find my code, my tests, and sometimes the professor's test files. You'll notice that Assignments 4-7 involve "shop" many times. Each assignment is building upon that project. Assignment 6 is a working form with assignment 7 being a refactoring process, both of which are functioning properly. 

For whatever reason, if you're running Nvidia ShadowPlay and you try running anything JOptionPane, or anything Java Swing I think, you will experience a display driver seizure to which you will need to ALT-F4 out of JOptionPane in order to recover. It seems that turning off ShadowPlay entirely will solve the problem, but the best solution is to test your code on a different device that doesn't have ShadowPlay at all.
